Description: This package contains some routines for conducting analysis on the relationship between the number of astronomical sources and their flux. This relationship is typically known as \emph{log(N) - log(S)} relationship. This package provides maximum likelihood estimation on the typical \emph{log(N) - log(S)} model and the broken power-law models.
